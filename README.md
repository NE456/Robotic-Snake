# Robotic-Snake
This modular robotic snake uses multiple articulated segments with independent actuators to mimic snake-like gaits such as slithering and inchworm motion, allowing it to navigate tight spaces, uneven terrain, and narrow gaps as a bio-inspired platform for exploration and search-and-rescue research. It was built using Arduino UNO.
