The design of the sanke robot was initially from (https://github.com/NOOBOTICS/SnakeRobot), which was modified and re-designed a bit for better movement and flexibility. 
The design was modified for better servo motor fitting and for smoother operation.
Thanking https://github.com/NOOBOTICS for the initial idea.
